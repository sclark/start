# [start](http://sclark.io/start "Stephen's Startpage")

This is my current startpage and usual newtab replacement page.

The search feature can be used to filter through links or to search the web using different search providers. The default search provider is Google, to indicate another search provider enter the search provider's key and then a space. (ex: To search with google enter "g *your search here*") The current search providers and associated keys are:
+ a : WolframAlpha
+ w : Wikipedia
+ g : Google
+ y : YouTube
+ d : DuckDuckGo
+ ! : *goes directly to the entered url*
